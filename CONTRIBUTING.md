# Contributing To GitHub Vet

Contributions are welcome, but to make good use of dev effort, please consider the following.

## Before raising a PR

If you want to make some changes, please start a discussion in the issue tracker first. This helps 
to avoid duplication of effort and wasted effort.

## Before starting work

Before beginning to work on an issue, please leave a comment stating you are planning to do so. 
You are encouraged to raise a draft PR against your feature branch to help track progress.
